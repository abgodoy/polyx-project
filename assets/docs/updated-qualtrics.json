Projects are health related and carried out in partnership with the Center for Health Disparities Research at UC Riverside’s School of Medicine. Students will gain an understanding of the social and structural mechanisms for how inequality “gets under the skin” while also gaining skills in participant observation, in-depth interviewing, life histories, material culture analysis, and qualitative data analysis using NVivo. Students are research assistants on the project and work collaboratively with undergraduate and graduate students at UC Riverside. The experience positions students for employment in the fields of social science research, public health, non-profit sectors and/or applying to graduate programs in anthropology, health sciences, and related professions. Past students have received intense mentorship, disseminated their research beyond the classroom, and work collaboratively on a multidisciplinary research team.",
