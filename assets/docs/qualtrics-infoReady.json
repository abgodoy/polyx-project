            "description": "During Fall semester, FST 4290L is a 2 unit laboratory, which means that the groups gather in the laboratory twice a week for 2:50 hours each time. During this time, I supervise the work of the students in the ideation sessions, prototype making, collection of quality parameters and assessing the sensory acceptability of the products. I also provide feedback on the reports to encourage critical think focus on technical problem solving to obtain the best possible prototype. \n\nNevertheless, mentorship and advising of the food product development teams does not finish at the end of the semester, in most cases the deadlines to submit the preliminary proposals to the national competitions and the final proposals, if selected as finalists, happen in the semester following the course. There is still a fair amount of work to refine and making the prototypes for the competitions, reviewing and revising the preliminary proposals, writing the full proposals and creating and practicing the oral and poster presentations. Besides the investment of time required by the students and me to conduct the activities described above, the challenges are mainly related to the lack of structure that the course provides once the semester is over and mainly the lack of assigned time to conduct the activities. \n\nFinally, the teams that submit their projects for competitions receive feedback from highly qualified judges from industry and academia that also help to guide the future development of the projects and can be consider a type of mentorship."

            "description": "Students receive mentorship from three sources. The first is through their faculty mentor, and any additional project mentors they take on. These mentors provide the most in-depth mentorship as they guide the students through the entire project development and implementation process.\n\nThe second is through Hatchery staff advisors and the Hatchery program itself. The Hatchery program's phases help provide students with a map to guide them through development and implementation. In the beginning of Phase I students also meet with the coordinator to develop their first action plan. In this meeting the coordinator ascertains the best way to make the Hatchery fit the team's needs. New teams are also required to present their project idea at a new team meeting attended by other new teams and the Hatchery advisors. After their presentation they receive feedback from their peers and the advisors. Advisors continue to provide feedback from team presentations, and meet with teams throughout their time in the Hatchery to help provide guidance on their projects.\n\nThe third method of mentorship comes from students' peers in the Hatchery. During Hatchery meetings Phase III teams are required to attend, and Phase I and II teams have the option to attend. Phase III teams present on the status of their projects and receive feedback from both advisors and peers. Their peers offer suggestions for troubleshooting issues and present alternative ideas for further research and exploration. Furthermore, the last portion of the meeting is dedicated to small group discussions. These discussions are largely student led and provide teams with the opportunity to learn from, and seek advice from, their peers."

He was editor of his college paper and worked in the news industry for seven years. The editorial advisor assists the students in developing a news budget, helps them refine their writing, offers layout and design advice, and helps them navigate journalism ethics and their relationships with sources. In addition to the regularly scheduled class\/lab meetings, the adviser spends Sunday afternoons with the editors to guide them in the news production process. The adviser is on-call and editors have access to their mentoring at any point during the semester. Intense mentoring also occurs between the more experienced student-editors and the new staff writers. They help lead writing workshops, they assign stories, edit and fact check copy for the reporters.\n\nIn addition, The Poly Post Business Manager, Linda Perez, mentors students from disciplines outside of communication in the areas of business, production, graphic design, marketing, and advertising. She has been the Business Manager at The Poly Post for the past 15 years and managed at Wells Fargo Financial prior to coming to Cal Poly Pomona. The business manager aids the students in developing new marketing plans, helps them refine their sales and technical skills, proposes layout and design advice for the magazine and newspaper, and provides guidance for industry standards. The business manager is also on-call and spends Sunday afternoons assisting the editors and approving pages before production."
